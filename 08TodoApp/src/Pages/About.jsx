        This Todo App is a React project I built using Context API and React Router.
        It lets users add, edit, delete, and mark their tasks as complete easily.
        I used Context to manage state cleanly without passing props everywhere.
        The Router helps switch between the Todo page and the About page smoothly.
        The app also includes a developer section that fetches info from GitHubâ€™s API.
        Itâ€™s designed to be simple, fast, and focused on task organization.
        Building it helped me practice React hooks, context, and real-world structure.
